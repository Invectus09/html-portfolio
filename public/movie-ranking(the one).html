<h2> My top three movies</h2>
<h3> Glass Onion</h3>
<p> By the far the best written movie I have seen seen lately. The characters potrays current affairs which occur in modern life. The actors are outstanding and they knew the task at hand and executed without fault.</p>
<h3> The Grey Man</h3>
<p> This movie for me is the golden egg of warfar and central intelligence. It only takes one rotten potato to ruin the whole bag and you only need the Ken Doll to fix that for you. </p>
<h3> Spiderman Far From Home</h3>
<p> This movie was really well written. The scenes where breathtaking as it potrayed the city of Italy very well.</p>
